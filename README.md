Doughnut plot for python that allows specific colors and labels to be applied, and can be used as a standard pie chart

Doughnut plots are not the preferred way to display proportional data, but sometimes you need their compactness. This is a simple 2-D plot that can be used to display 'n' categories of data in 'm' datasets when given an m x n list of values. Keyworded arguments allow for adding explicit colors and labels for each category of data, and also allows the plot to be collapsed to a standard pie chart.
